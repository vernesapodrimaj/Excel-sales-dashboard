Data Cleaning, analysis and vizualization
## 💼 Background & Daily Experience
As part of my daily work, I regularly use Excel and other Microsoft Office programs to manage, clean, and analyze data, create financial reports, and support project documentation. This hands-on experience has strengthened my ability to work efficiently with large datasets and deliver clear, insightful visualizations.
## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze sales data and create an interactive, user-friendly dashboard to uncover key business insights. I began by asking questions such as:
Which age group purchases the most?
What are the top-selling product categories?
Which countries generate the highest number of orders?
How do sales trends vary across months and years?

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
Microsoft Excel (Mac)
Pivot Tables
Interactive Slicers (Age Group, Year, Gender, Country)
Charts: Stacked Bar, Line Chart, Map
Data Cleaning (Text to Columns, Formatting, Formulas)

## 🧹 Data Preparation
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle in raw text format and required extensive cleaning before analysis. Key steps included:
Using Text to Columns to separate and structure the raw input
Applying consistent data formatting across all fields (e.g., converting general to date, number, text, currency, and geographic formats)
Standardizing categorical values (e.g., replacing “M” and “F” with “Male” and “Female”)
Using the PROPER function to ensure uniform capitalization across text fields
Renaming column headers for clarity and removing special characters to improve readability
Formatting numeric columns with appropriate number and currency styles for consistency
Freezing the top row and adjusting column widths to enhance usability during analysis
Cleaning and transforming over 10,000 rows of data to ensure integrity and consistency
Reorganizing and duplicating columns for better structure, followed by removing unnecessary fields
Ensuring all slicer-related columns were cleaned and formatted to avoid filter errors later

## 📌 Pivot Table as the Foundation
A central Pivot Table was created to group and summarize the dataset by various dimensions—product category, customer age group, country, and time. It powered the entire dashboard and allowed for interactive filtering using slicers.

## 📈 Dashboard Insights
The final dashboard includes various interactive charts and filters:
Stacked Bar Chart: Shows monthly sales, highlighting peaks in June, July, and a major spike in December. Bikes consistently outperformed Clothing and Accessories in total sales.
Line Chart (Yearly Orders): Displays no orders between 2011–2012. Clothing had the highest order volume, while Bikes and Accessories followed closely.
Line Chart (Orders by Age Group): Adults are the most active buyers, followed by young customers. Senior orders were minimal.
Map Chart: Visualizes orders by country, showing the United States leading by a significant margin, followed by Australia. The map color intensity reflects order volume.
